# 📄 Local Document Diff Agent (Offline LLM System)

A fully offline, privacy-first document comparison engine powered by local LLM inference.  
It detects structural and semantic differences between two documents and presents a structured compliance report through a Streamlit interface.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This system compares two documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and performs:

- 📌 Structural diffing (added / removed clauses)  
- 🧠 Semantic change detection using a local LLM  
- ⚖️ Risk classification of clause modifications  
- 📊 Interactive UI for reviewing differences  

All processing happens locally on your machine—no cloud APIs, no data transmission.

## 🧪 Features

✔ Structural Diffing

Detects:

Added clauses

Removed clauses

✔ Semantic Change Detection

Uses local LLM to classify:

Wording changes

Obligation shifts

No material change

✔ Risk Scoring

Each modified clause is labeled:

Low

Medium

High

✔ Fully Offline Execution

No internet required after model download.

🧰 Example Output

{
  "change_type": "Obligation Shifted",

  "summary": "Payment timeline changed from 30 days to 60 days",

  "risk": "High"
}
